# Ellipsoidal_X-ray_Experiment
A Geant4 simulation to demonstrate the advantages of using ellipsoidal targets for X-ray tubes.

In this simulation, 30,000 electrons are launched at either flat (45 degree angle) or ellipsoidal (particle source at one of foci) targets at energies of 50 keV - 500 keV.
Gamma photons created are located in corresponding folders at data/data_raw. For flat target, electrons are launched with a 2 degree angle to the axis to simulate a focal spot.
For ellipsoidal (curved) target, electrons are launched with a 10 degree angle to axis to simulate rotating beam which should improve thermal characteristics of the X-ray tube.
Decreasing the second angle might improve gamma yield of the curved target.
